# Failure Pattern Reference

Use this when a bug has repeated, a first fix did not hold, or the symptom smells like runtime state rather than local code syntax.

## Stale Verifier Or Tool Cache

Signals: verifier output points at deleted temp worktrees, old generated files, or paths outside the current repo; rerunning after a clean checkout changes the file path but not the current code.

Checks:
- Confirm the reported path exists.
- Clear the tool cache only after proving the path is stale.
- Re-run the same verifier from the current repo root.

## Worker Queue Or DB Boundary

Signals: UI says work is running but no worker processes it; logs show scheduler activity but no queued row; retry fixes one item but not the pipeline.

Checks:
- Trace request -> enqueue -> worker pickup -> persistence -> UI refresh.
- Inspect queue rows or job state directly.
- Add a regression test around the enqueue boundary, not only the worker body.

## Generated Rebuild Boundary

Signals: source changed but generated output, app bundle, CLI artifact, archive, checksum, or release package still contains old behavior.

Checks:
- Identify the source-to-artifact rule.
- Verify the build system watches the source path.
- Inspect the generated artifact contents, not just the source diff.

## Guard Lifetime Race

Signals: permission, auth, or state guard looks correct locally but a delayed callback, app relaunch, or alternate entry point bypasses it.

Checks:
- Trace guard creation, retention, invalidation, and every alternate entry point.
- Verify cold launch, warm launch, deep link/file open, and retry paths when applicable.
- Prefer explicit durable state over transient flags when the guard must survive relaunch.

## Atomic Temp Filename

Signals: concurrent runs collide, cleanup removes the wrong file, or a partially written output is observed.

Checks:
- Use unique temp directories or atomic rename.
- Keep cleanup scoped to files created by the current run.
- Test two concurrent or back-to-back runs when the tool supports it.

## Path, Cwd, Or Symlink Escape

Signals: an operation intended for one root touches a sibling directory, follows a symlink unexpectedly, or behaves differently from another working directory.

Checks:
- Resolve and compare canonical roots before writing or deleting.
- Reject paths outside the allowed root after symlink resolution.
- Reproduce from a non-default cwd and through any UI entry point that supplies paths.

## CLI Effect Scope Drift

Signals: preview, dry-run, size, count, or report output is computed from one predicate, but execution mutates a broader or different set.

Checks:
- Trace display, dry-run, and mutation predicates to the same source of truth.
- Compare planned paths or records with executor input in a regression test.
- Assert partial failures report the exact skipped and completed items.

## CLI Wrapper Or PATH Drift

Signals: source-tree invocation works, but the installed command, package wrapper, PATH shim, completion, or package-manager install path runs old code or a different binary.

Checks:
- Inspect built package contents, shebang, executable bit, and wrapper target.
- Reproduce through a temp prefix or package-manager install path, not only from source.
- Check PATH order and use absolute system-tool paths where wrappers should not intercept.

## Interactive Stdin Or TTY Hang

Signals: CI stalls, spinner never finishes, a subprocess reads from the script body, or an auth prompt appears in non-interactive mode.

Checks:
- Reproduce with stdin redirected and with TTY/non-TTY paths separated.
- Add test-mode or no-auth guards around real prompts and system changes.
- Stub external prompt tools through PATH when timeout wrappers exec real binaries.

## Subprocess Pipe Backpressure

Signals: a long-running child process hangs only on large output, small fixtures pass, or the parent waits for exit before reading stdout/stderr. The child may be blocked on a full pipe buffer while the parent is blocked on `wait`.

Checks:
- Drain stdout and stderr while the process runs, or explicitly inherit/redirect streams when output is not needed.
- Test with output larger than a typical pipe buffer, not only tiny fixtures.
- Preserve stderr tails or structured error output for diagnostics without holding the whole stream in memory.

## Signal Or Partial-Failure Mapping

Signals: cancel, timeout, SIGINT, or SIGTERM is reported as success or as a normal business failure; temp files, locks, or operation logs make retries look complete.

Checks:
- Classify interrupted execution separately from success and expected validation failures.
- Assert temp cleanup, lock release, and operation-log state after interruption.
- Test retry and idempotency after a partial write.

## CLI Stream Contract Regression

Signals: automation breaks after human logs, progress output, JSON shape, stdout/stderr routing, or exit-code behavior changes.

Checks:
- Assert exit code, stdout, and stderr separately in CLI tests.
- Keep human diagnostics off stdout for machine-readable modes.
- Snapshot or parse JSON/schema output and include non-interactive coverage.

## Snapshot Rebuild Drops Carried Field

Signals: live data shows up at the data source and on the wire but a downstream view sees it empty; the field has a default value (`var x: [T] = []`, `var y: Int? = nil`) that lets memberwise init compile without it; the symptom appears only on the path where the snapshot is rebuilt (icon resolution, decoration, redaction), not on a fresh fetch.

Checks:
- Trace whether every code path that constructs the snapshot type passes the field. The Swift compiler does not warn on default-value omission in memberwise init.
- Add a unit test that fetches the snapshot, runs the rebuild path, and asserts the carried field equals the input.
- Prefer `with(...)` mutating helpers or `inout` mutation over fresh memberwise init when only one field is changing.

## Multi-Sample Command Cold Start

Signals: a CLI tool that takes `-l N` / `--samples N` / `--repeat N` returns one block of zeros and one block of real data; aggregating all blocks yields zeros; only the second sample carries real measurements.

Checks:
- Read the tool's man page for cold-start semantics. `top -l 2`, `iostat -d 2`, `vm_stat 1 2`, etc. all share this shape.
- Slice the output to the latest sample (`.suffix(perSampleSize)` on parsed lines, or look for the second instance of the header row).
- When in doubt, raise `-l` to 3 and confirm sample 2 and 3 agree; sample 1 stays zero.

## Locale-Dependent Subprocess Output

Signals: numbers parse correctly for the author and come back zero, truncated, or wildly wrong for some users; a percentage, size, or duration is right in one region and broken in another; the same parser was already patched once for a different field.

Checks:
- Force a fixed locale on every subprocess whose output is parsed (`LC_ALL=C` or the platform equivalent) rather than repairing each parser for comma decimal separators, digit grouping, or translated field labels.
- Fix this at the spawn boundary, not per call site. This shape arrives as three or four separate reports (one metric, then another, then a rendered summary) and each pointwise patch hides how many parsers are still exposed.
- Treat translated output as a format change, not a string change: field order, units, and label names can all move.

## Single-Probe Existence Check

Signals: a "is it installed / running / registered / active" verdict is wrong for a subset of users, and the wrong verdict then drives a destructive or user-visible action (flagged as orphaned, offered for deletion, a feature silently disabled). The subset shares an install method, a packaging convention, or an OS feature the probe does not know about.

Checks:
- List every legitimate way the subject can exist, then confirm the probe sees all of them. One index query, one PATH lookup, one process name, or one interface-name prefix is a partial view: system indexes can be disabled or skip a packaging convention, nested or embedded components are not registered where top-level ones are, and OS-owned interfaces borrow the naming a third-party feature also uses.
- Distinguish "probe timed out" from "subject absent". A slow index is unknown, not proof of absence; a timed-out fast path must fall through to a direct check, never to a negative verdict.
- Weight the failure asymmetrically: when the verdict authorizes removal, a false "absent" destroys data while a false "present" only leaves something behind. Require corroboration from a second source before the destructive branch.

## Aggregation Key Variant

Signals: a count, log roll-up, event tally, or per-category breakdown is short by some entries; the missing items share a trait (a system-derived path, a localized string, a prefixed command name); the base-form key matches but a derived variant (`<base>-system`, a suffix, a prefix) is silently dropped.

Checks:
- Before adding a category, grep every write site that produces this class of key and enumerate the real variants, not just the base form.
- Match with `hasPrefix` / a regex / an explicit variant list rather than exact equality on the base key.
- Add a fixture row for each known variant so a future key shape that escapes the matcher fails the test instead of the aggregate.

## Whole-Buffer Decode Collapse

Signals: a parser that works on your machine returns nothing on someone else's; the affected user has an accented device name, a non-ASCII filename, or an unusual process argument; the failure is total (every row gone) rather than partial (one row garbled). Distinct from pipe backpressure: the bytes arrived, the decode threw them away.

Checks:
- Find every strict decode of bytes produced by a child process, a device, or the filesystem (`String(data:encoding:)`, `from_utf8`, `decode('utf-8')` with no `errors=`). One invalid byte nils the entire buffer, and callers that coalesce nil to empty turn it into "the command produced nothing".
- Decode leniently wherever the bytes are a report to parse; keep the strict decode only where the bytes are a signature or checksum being verified, and fail closed there. Both stances belong in one codebase for different call sites.
- Check what the empty result means downstream. A safety guard that reads an empty process list as "nothing is running" fails open, which is the dangerous direction on a destructive path.
- Real failure is reported by exit status and timeout, not by decode success. Point callers at those instead.

## Denied Read Returns A Plausible Value

Signals: a metric is right for some subjects and wrong for others, and the split follows ownership: your own processes/files are correct, root-owned or other-user ones read zero, stale, or absent. No error is logged because the API answered.

Checks:
- Measure the boundary instead of reading the docs: run the call across owned and non-owned subjects and count how many succeed. "33 of 33 own, 0 of 5 root's" is the evidence; a guess is not.
- Check whether the fallback for a denied read carries the same meaning as the primary source. Two different meanings in one column is the bug, even when each value is individually defensible.
- Prefer a source that answers uniformly for every subject (a tool that reports all processes regardless of owner) over a precise one that silently degrades for some.

## Recovery Gated On The Artifact It Restores

Signals: a repair, reinstall, or self-heal path reports the same dead end no matter how many times it runs; the broken state persists across reinstalls; the repair "has always been there" but no evidence exists that it ever succeeded.

Checks:
- Read the repair path's own precondition and ask whether it is true in the broken state it exists to fix. A recovery gated on the file that is missing can never fire.
- Verify every absolute tool path in a repair command actually exists on the platform. A wrong path exits non-zero, an `&&` chain silently stops, and the repair no-ops on every machine forever. Add a test that walks each path in the command and asserts it is executable.
- Do not let a test assert the source shape of the repair command; that pins the broken form as correct. Assert the observable end state instead (the service is registered, the file exists, the probe answers).
- Make the repair own the outcome rather than assume it: write the artifact, then prove it by querying the system, and log the query's raw output instead of discarding it.

## Watchdog Tuned To The Fast Path

Signals: an operation is reported as failed, stalled, or "no progress" while it was actually healthy; the report comes from users on slow links, cold caches, network volumes, or large payloads; retrying makes it fail at the same elapsed time every run.

Checks:
- For each timeout constant, name the slowest *healthy* case (a several-hundred-MB download on a slow link, a first-of-day index rebuild, a tool rebuilding its cache after a cleanup) and confirm the constant clears it with margin. This is the inverse of magic-wait coupling: there the timer is too loose to be a real signal, here it is too tight to allow a healthy slow case.
- Replace "no output for N seconds" with a real liveness probe (a growing temp file, a byte counter, a heartbeat) and keep the timeout as the genuine stall guard.
- For each watchdog, enumerate every exit from the region it guards, including thrown errors and forks into an alternate path. A watchdog that survives a fork fires in the middle of the path that replaced it.
- Check whether a second bound already covers a genuinely hung run. If so, the extra timer can only ever fire early.

## Display-String Comparison

Signals: a comparison based on user-facing text produces a verdict that never resolves: a perpetual "update available" that installs nothing, a diff that always reports changed, a match that never fires. The two sides format the same underlying value differently.

Checks:
- Ask whether the compared value's *format* is part of a contract or something the producer restyles at will. Version display strings, filenames derived from a URL tail, and localized labels are all free-form.
- Find the machine-facing identity the platform intends for ordering or equality (a build number, a content hash, an id) and compare that, falling back to the display form only when the identity is absent on either side.
- When the fallback must stay, suppress the verdict where both strings carry the identical token sequence in a different arrangement; no genuinely newer or changed value can satisfy that.
- Fix every channel that repeats the comparison, not the one that produced the report. This shape is almost always duplicated.
